# Interjections

This software generated the website at [http://interjections.metadada.xyz](http://interjections.metadada.xyz).

I have been reading Hansard transcripts for a while and one thing that stands out is the moments where the prepared Parliamentary speeches transition into something less scripted. In Open Australia's XML, these are typically labeled as "interjections" so I've used that for the name. This project processes all the available transcripts and automatically extracts all exchanges that appear to happen around these interjections. To what end? I'm not sure - I need to read them more. At first glance, they do provide a sort of summary, even if they aren't particularly _substantial_.

All data comes from: [http://www.openaustralia.org.au](http://www.openaustralia.org.au) and if you look in app.py you will see how it is pulled in and parsed.
